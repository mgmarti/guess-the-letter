# Guess the letter

## Homework 3
Create one of two possible computer games - the specifications are below. These apps will run in the browser, and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code.

## Requirements:
Your UI (user interface) should contain the following text:

Guess what letter I'm thinking of

Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)

Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)

Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)

Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).

When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
